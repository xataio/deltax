# RTABench join-query planner work

Current-state analysis of pg_deltax's planner behaviour on the join-heavy
RTABench queries, and the estimator work to fix it. (The long historical
progress log was dropped on 2026-05-31; this is the fresh start.)

Benchmark box: EC2 `c6a.4xlarge`, PG18, 181M `order_events`, `order_items`
105M, `orders` 10M, `customers` 1,102, `products` 9,255. `order_events` is
pg_deltax-managed: `order_by = [order_id, event_created]`, no segment-by,
30K-row segments, 3-day partitions.

## 1 · Harness fixes (done, committed)

Two RTABench-harness handicaps were removed (commits `2661f0a`, `7b6b9fd`):

- **`SET enable_nestloop = off` removed.** A pre-parallel-era guard against
  a mis-estimated NestLoop blow-up. With today's parallel-safe
  `DeltaXAppend` + PK-index probes into the dimension tables, nested loops
  are the *best* plan for the join queries; forcing them off cost 2–11×.
- **`work_mem` 8GB → 50MB.** Only ever load-bearing for the old 105M-row
  hash builds; the nested-loop plans use negligible memory. 50MB matches
  the TimescaleDB harness exactly (apples-to-apples).

Result (full benchmark, lukewarm-cold, 3×/query): suite **21.6 s → 12.7 s**;
vs TimescaleDB 29.3 s → pg_deltax **2.3× faster** overall. Only Q03
(tiny EXISTS) regressed (+91 ms). `run.sh` drops OS caches per query, so
these numbers are ~2× the fully-warm isolated times.

## 2 · The estimator gap (issues #20 + #21)

`DeltaXAppend` row estimates on compressed partitions are badly low, which
mis-drives join planning. Canonical case:

```
event_type='Delivered' AND event_created IN [2024-01-01, 2024-07-01)
  estimated rows = 8        actual = 4,207,526
```

Two independent causes:

1. **No histogram for `event_created`** (the dominant error). `src/stats.rs`
   writes only `stadistinct`/`stanullfrac`/`stawidth`, so range-predicate
   selectivity falls back to PG's default and collapses — even for
   partitions fully inside the WHERE range, where the true selectivity is
   1.0. → **issue #20.**
2. **`event_type` n_distinct was wrong** via the standalone-analyze path:
   `analyze_partition_from_catalog` SUMmed per-segment `_colstats._ndistinct`
   → 264 for a 9-value column. → **issue #21.**

### Why this is dangerous, not just slow — the Q30 NestLoop trap

With nested loops on (§1), a `rows=8` estimate doesn't just cost a little;
it flips the join order catastrophically. Q30 with stats present
(n_distinct fix, no histogram):

```
Nested Loop  (Join Filter: c.customer_id = o.customer_id)
  -> Index Scan customers c            (1,102 rows)            ← outer
  -> Materialize                       (est 61, actual 4.2M)  ← inner, re-scanned 1,102×
       -> Gather -> Nested Loop
            -> Parallel DeltaXAppend order_events  rows=8 (actual 4.2M)
            -> Index Scan orders_pkey
```

1,102 × 4.2M ≈ 4.6B comparisons → **254 seconds** (vs 1.7 s healthy).

**Key lesson:** the no-stats baseline (12.7 s) is only safe by luck — its
`rows=97` estimate stays just high enough to avoid the flip. Writing
accurate n_distinct *without* the histogram pushes the estimate to `rows=8`
and triggers the trap. So **#21 must not be enabled without #20** — they
ship together. The histogram is the load-bearing fix.

## 3 · #21 — n_distinct fix (done)

`analyze_partition_from_catalog` reads the authoritative merged-HLL counts
persisted at compression time in `deltax.deltax_partition.column_ndistinct`
(keyed by column name), instead of re-deriving a SUM from `_colstats`.
Columns missing from the persisted map are left for PG to default. Validated:
`event_type` n_distinct **264 → 9**; `event_type='Delivered'` estimate
**475K → 20M** (actual 8.4M).

## 4 · #20 — histograms + parent stats (done; one follow-up)

Implemented in `src/stats.rs`:

- **Per-column histograms** (`stakind=2`) for order-by / time columns whose
  min/max is an order-preserving i64 (INT2/4/8, DATE, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMPTZ),
  built from the persisted `column_minmax`. `pg_statistic.stavalues` is an
  `anyarray` pseudo-type column that **cannot** be populated via SQL INSERT,
  so the tuple is formed in C (`form_and_insert_pg_statistic` →
  `heap_form_tuple` + `CatalogTupleInsert`), like PG's own ANALYZE.
- **Parent-relation stats** (`write_table_stats`, `stainherit=true`): the
  partitions are scanned through one `DeltaXAppend`, so the planner reads
  join/range selectivity from the *parent's* pg_statistic. Per-partition
  stats are merged onto the parent — n_distinct via a disjoint/overlap
  heuristic (`merge_ndistinct`), plus a multi-bucket histogram from the
  sorted per-partition minimums.

**Three bugs found and fixed during on-EC2 validation:**
1. `anyarray` rejects SQL INSERT of a concrete array → form the tuple in C.
2. `pgrx`'s `Oid::into_datum()` maps `InvalidOid`→SQL NULL, so `stacoll1`
   became NULL and PG silently ignored the histogram → build the 0 Datum
   directly (same guard for the int2/float4 catalog columns).
3. **`stanullfrac = 1.0` on `event_created`** — the order-by/time column's
   `_colstats._nonnull_count` reads 0, and `(rows−0)/rows = 1.0` told PG the
   column was all-NULL, zeroing its range selectivity `(1−nullfrac)` and
   neutralising the histogram → fixed via `attnotnull` + guarding the 0 case.

**Results (EC2, full suite vs the no-stats 12.7 s baseline):** Q30 254s-trap
**eliminated** (1.36 s); Q3 −49%, Q4 −24%, Q25 −45%, Q27 −52%, Q30 −21%.
`clippy` clean, 547 unit tests pass.

### 4.1 · Global HLL (Q17) + MCV (Q19) — done

Two further estimator pieces, both shipped and validated on the full EC2
dataset after a reload:

**Global HLL — fixes Q17.** `top_selling_month_product` regressed 928 ms →
6.3 s once stats existed, because the `oe ⋈ order_items` join cardinality was
overestimated (45M vs 6.3M). `card = rows1·rows2 / max(nd1, nd2)`, and the
merged parent `oe.order_id` came out 19 767 — `merge_ndistinct` took MAX since
order_id's per-partition ranges all overlap `[1, large]`, so a min/max
heuristic can't see the values are disjoint sets across time partitions. Fix:
the per-segment HLL sketches both load paths used to discard are now unioned
into a per-partition sketch (`column_hll`) and merged table-wide in
`write_table_stats`. Local reload: parent order_id n_distinct 250 344 vs true
249 999 (0.1%); EC2 full: ~10M → correct join card. **Q17 6.3 s → 1.22 s.**
(It picks a hash join, not the 0.7 s nested loop — `order_items.order_id`'s own
ANALYZE n_distinct is 458 808, a PG underestimate — but 1.22 s is 5.7× faster
than TimescaleDB, so not worth chasing.)

**MCV — fixes Q19.** The reload exposed a worse case: `out_of_stock_products`
hit **871 seconds**. Its `NOT EXISTS (… event_type='Shipped')` filters a value
that doesn't exist; with only stadistinct, PG estimated it at `1/9` of the
table (~20M) instead of ~0, so the anti-join was estimated at ~1 row and put a
224K-row result on the inner of a Materialize'd nested loop re-scanned once per
product (9255×). Fix: write an MCV list (`stakind=1`) for low-cardinality
columns from the persisted `column_valmap` (the column's complete distinct-value
set). The slot-1 writer now carries a histogram *or* an MCV; frequencies are
uniform summing to 1.0 (no exact counts), keeping present values at
`1/ndistinct` while estimating absent values at ~0 (stadistinct = value count
→ no "other" distinct). Written at the **child** level (equality filters on
`order_events` are estimated per-child then summed) and the parent.
`event_type='Shipped'` estimate **20M → 128**; **Q19 871 s → 0.70 s**.
Reload-free — `column_valmap` is already persisted; just re-run
`deltax_analyze_table`.

### 4.2 · Final EC2 suite (181M events, reloaded, vs no-stats baseline)

Suite **12.73 s → 11.99 s** (−6%); **2.4× faster than TimescaleDB** (29.3 s).
Q19 871 s → 0.70 s, Q30 −21%, Q3 −48%, Q27 −52%, Q25 −42%, Q5 −28%, Q23 −15%.
The only query slower than the (accidentally-NL) no-stats baseline is Q17
(0.93 s → 1.22 s), still 5.7× faster than TimescaleDB. No disasters; every
join query beats or ties TimescaleDB.

### 4.3 · Automatic stats population

`pg_statistic` is now populated automatically on every load path, so no manual
`deltax_analyze_table` is needed:

- **Compress path** (background worker / `deltax_compress_partition`): writes
  per-partition stats at compress time (already did); the worker now also
  refreshes the parent-relation merged stats after each auto-compress cycle.
- **Direct backfill** (`COPY … FORMAT deltax_compress_csv`): the per-partition
  stats weren't written incrementally, so `handle_copy_from_inner` runs
  `analyze_table_impl` once after all partitions are compressed (child + parent
  in one pass).

`deltax_analyze_table` remains as a manual refresh (e.g. after upgrading to a
build that writes new stat kinds — like this one — on already-compressed data).
`rtabench/benchmark.sh` no longer runs it, and excludes `order_events` from its
plain `ANALYZE` (a plain ANALYZE on the partitioned parent samples the empty
compressed heaps and would clobber the inheritance-tree stats).

### 4.4 · Parent-stats bugs (found via ClickBench/RTABench re-run)

The parent (table-level) stats merge across all partitions; two bugs there
regressed Q20 (and looked like they fixed Q06, but didn't — see §4.5):

- **Parent nullfrac must be aggregated, not assumed 0.** Hardcoding 0 made
  `backup_processor <> ''` (a ~98 %-NULL column) estimate ~100 % instead of
  ~2 %. Now the row-count-weighted average of the children's `stanullfrac`.
- **Only write a parent MCV when the valmap union is complete.** A partition
  with >32 distinct values contributes no valmap, so the union can be a strict
  subset; writing an MCV from it advertises a bogus tiny `n_distinct` for a
  high-cardinality column. Guard: `valmap-union size == merged-HLL n_distinct`.

### 4.5 · The actual Q06 regression — DeltaXAppend gating (not a stats bug)

Q06 `order_events_without_backups` (`backup_processor <> '' ORDER BY
event_created LIMIT 10`) regressed 55 ms → 17.6 s, and it took two wrong
guesses to find: it is **not** a stats problem — the stats are correct, and the
plan flips between the fast parent `Custom Scan (DeltaXAppend)` (executor prunes
all-empty segments, sorts a few K rows) and a slow per-partition `Append` +
3.6 M-row `Sort`.

Root cause in `scan::hook::collect_compressed_children`: it disables the
DeltaXAppend path if any *non-compressed* child might hold data, using
`pg_class.reltuples` as the proxy (`==0` ⇒ ANALYZE-proven-empty, skip; else
bail). pg_deltax's own empty partitions — the default and the future partitions
the background worker pre-creates — are **never analyzed** (`reltuples == −1`),
so the proxy bailed on them and disabled DeltaXAppend for any query that
doesn't prune them away via a time filter (Q06/Q19/Q20). Queries with a tight
`event_created` range (Q17 etc.) prune those partitions, so they were unaffected
— which is why it looked query-specific and intermittent (it only triggers once
the worker has created the future partitions; an immediately-post-load run looks
fine). It was *exposed* by §4.3 removing `order_events` from benchmark.sh's plain
`ANALYZE` — that ANALYZE had been incidentally setting the empty partitions to
`reltuples=0`.

Fix: gate on the **physical heap size** (`RelationGetNumberOfBlocksInFork`)
instead of `reltuples`. 0 blocks ⇒ no row ever inserted ⇒ safe to skip; >0 ⇒
assume data and bail (conservative — a drained-but-unvacuumed partition stays on
the safe side). Independent of ANALYZE, so it's stable. Q06 17.6 s → 54 ms.
Final suite **11.7 s** (−8 % vs no-stats, 2.5× faster than TimescaleDB).
